NOTES

This class will eventually be a separate assembly, as an embedded resource in Nivot.PowerShell.SharePoint.DLL
This is to allow dynamic loading of the localsharepointmodel -- this will permit loading of this provider on a non-sharepoint
box (since microsoft.sharepoint.dll is not needed) where the remote objectmodel will loaded instead.
