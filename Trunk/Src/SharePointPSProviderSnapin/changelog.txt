Todo:
	* respect PS filters
	* support sps -- e.g. recognize areas versus webs
	* implement last item cache
	* implement shouldprocess etc
	
Outstanding bugs/features:
	* doesn't recognize sps areas, gets access denied, but can still navigate stuff
	* path resolution is not case-sensitive; need to allow for case-sensitive behaviour (FIXED)
	* only supports drive-qualified operation, need to implement SharePoint::\\server\path\ syntax

Ideas:
	* ...

CHANGELOG:

20070526
========
    * the last year's worth of changes are logged in TFS now, on codeplex. This list is just for historic purposes.
    
20060428
========
	* added some dynamic assembly loading code to SharePointObjectModel, courtesy of http://blog.magenic.com/brante/archive/2006/01/03/2183.aspx
	  this will be used later to dynamically load the LocalSharePointObjectModel. This allows the provider to load on a non-sharepoint box,
	  which is needed for the remote objectmodel functionality to work.
	* moved the generic BaseStoreProvider code to Nivot.PowerShell namespace; was previously lumped in with Nivot.PowerShell.SharePoint
	* appended .Commands to Cmdlet namespace, as per Microsoft recommendations

20060426
========
	* "PowerShelled" everything
	* replaced custom Adder and Remover delegates with newly discovered System.Action<T> delegate
	
20060407
========
	* started work on two cmdlets: import-listitem & export-listitem

20060403
========
	* added StoreItemFlags for allowing certain items to tab complete but not be sent to pipe and vice-versa
	* changed path resolution to be case-insenstive

	* added default child items for various wrappers classes, e.g. role default child is users

	* now supports infinitely nested paths, even circular ones
	* new containers, new items
	
20060331
